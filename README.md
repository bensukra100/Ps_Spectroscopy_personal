# Positronium Spectroscopy
This repository is a collection of work I had done in the [Positronium Spectroscopy group at UCL](https://antimattergravity.com/) ([Github](https://github.com/PositroniumSpectroscopy)) as part of my undergraduate research project. This repository includes simulations/calculations for:
* Rydberg positronium lifetimes
* Rydberg positronium wavefunctions
* Calculations of the Stark Effect and Ionisation Rates for Rydberg positronium
* Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC) simulations of Rydberg positronium in electric fields
* and other shorter scripts I worked on
